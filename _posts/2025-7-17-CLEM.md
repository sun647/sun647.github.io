## 1. Pre-Experiment Preparation

### a. Transfer Shuttle Drying
- Dry the **Transfer Shuttle** on the **Leica Cryo Tool Dryer (CTD)** for **at least 20 minutes** before use to reduce contamination.

### b. Cryo Stage Heating
- Run **stage heating** for **30 minutes at 60°C**:
  - **Do not** connect the LN₂ hose.
  - **Lift the objective** to the uppermost position (fully retracted).

---

## 2. Power On Sequence

### a. Microscope
- Turn on the microscope, the control panel and the pump. 
- Turn on the **camera**.

### b. Laser
- **Important**: Turn on the **front switch** of the laser **before** the **back switch**.
  - Otherwise, the laser will not power on.

---

## 3. Launch Imaging Software

- Start **LAS X** software.

---

## 4. Initialize Motorized Stage

- Click **Initialize Stage**.
- ⚠️ Do **not** block the stage — allow it to move freely during initialization.

---

## 5. Select Imaging Mode

- Navigate to:  
  `MatrixScreener → Matrix MAPS + CLEM`

---

## 6. Fill Liquid Nitrogen (LN₂)

- Fill **LN₂ into the storage tank**.
- ⚠️ **Do not** fill all the way to the top:
  - LN₂ may **spill** when inserting the heat exchanger.

---

## 7. Connect Cryo Hose to Pump and Stage

### a. Start the Pump
- Press **COOL** to start.

### b. Wait for Purge
- Wait until the **hose is purging nitrogen gas**.

### c. Connect Hose to Cryo Stage
- Insert the hose into the cryo stage.
- **Lock** the hose in place:
  - Push the **locking screw toward the hose** while tightening.
  - ⚠️ If not pushed first, the hose may be pulled out easily and won't seal properly.
    - Moisture may enter and condense, blocking the view.

---

## 8. Wait for Stage Cool Down

- When temperature reaches **-195°C**, **wait another 15 minutes** before loading the sample.

---

## 9. Cool Down the Transfer Shuttle

### a. Setup
- Ensure the **transfer shuttle shutter is closed**.

### b. Insert Cartridge
- Place an **empty cartridge** into the **loading position**.
- Close the **slider**.
- Turn the **rod** to the **open-O** position.
- Cover the cartridge with the **shielding**.

### c. Fill LN₂
- Cover the transfer shuttle with its **lid**.
- Open the **rotatable opening**.
- Fill LN₂ inside the shuttle.
  - ⚠️ **Do not overfill** — avoid pouring over the rod.
  - Otherwise, the **rod may freeze** and become immobile.

- The shuttle is **fully cooled** when the LN₂ **stops boiling** inside.

---

## 10. Load AutoGrids into Cartridge

- Proceed with **loading autogrids** into the pre-cooled cartridge.

---

## 11. Load Grid into Microscope

### a. Ensure Lens Is Up
- ⚠️ Objective lens must be lifted to **avoid damage** from the shuttle.

### b. Stage Access
- Open the **stage slider**.

### c. Insert Transfer Rod
- Insert the **transfer rod fully**.
- Rotate to **Open** position to **release the cartridge**.
  - ⚠️ Must insert **all the way** to the end.
  - Otherwise, you **won’t be able to focus** on the grid.

### d. Retract Rod
- Pull the rod back.
  - The **cartridge should remain** in the stage.

### e. Clean Up Shuttle
- Remove the **transfer shuttle** from the stage.
- Pour out any **remaining LN₂**.
- Place it on the **Cryo Tool Dryer (CTD)** for baking out.

---
## 12. Imaging Procedure

### a. Load Experiment
- Open **LAS X** and **load your experiment**.

### b. Move to Left Grid
- In the MatrixScreener window:
  - **Right-click** the **left grid**.
  - Select **"Move stage to left grid center"**.

### c. Autofocus
- Run **Auto Focus**.
- ⚠️ If autofocus **fails**, adjust **manually** until sharp.

### d. Spiral Scan
- Run the **Spiral Scan** to locate good regions for imaging.

### e. Focus Map Setup
- Select a **circular imaging area**.
- Click on several points **within the circle** to define a **focus map**.
- Click **Start Focus Map** to collect Z positions.

### f. Mosaic Scan
- Enable **4 channels**.
- Adjust the **Z-stack range** according to your sample thickness.
- Click **Run Matrix** to begin automated imaging.

### g. Export Data
- After acquisition is finished, **export data files** for downstream analysis.

---
## 13. Finishing Up

### a. Close Software
- Exit the **LAS X** software and any other imaging applications.

### b. Retrieve Grids
- **Lift the objective lens** to its uppermost position.
- **Retrieve the cryo grids** from the stage.

### c. Heat the Stage
- On the **temperature control box**, press **"Heat"**.
- Wait until the stage heats to **60°C**.

> ⚠️ **Do not** remove the hose **before** the temperature reaches 60°C.  
> Removing the hose prematurely can cause **damage** due to freezing.

### d. Disconnect the Cryo System
- Once the stage is at 60°C:
  - **Remove the LN₂ hose**.
  - **Remove the pump** from the LN₂ tank.

### e. Return Grid Boxes
- Place the **used grid boxes** back into the **LN₂ storage tank** for long-term storage.
